# Chanate Bank
Android Banking app  created to master OOP concepts.

This app works with using a singleton pattern, calling a bank logic object every time I want to perform a bank related action in the current app view.
The app saves data in local jsons, this practice was done to learn how to write and read data and put it into objects to use in app.
